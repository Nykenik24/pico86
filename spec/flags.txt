Flag can refer to one or more bits that are used to store a binary value or a Boolean variable for signaling special code conditions.

In the case of the Pico86, flags store useful informations as booleans, where `0` is false and `1` is true, that can serve to store logical instruction results, such as `AND`/`OR`/`XOR`/etc.

Flag list
=============
* OF: Overflow flag
- Indicates if an arithmetic overflow has ocurred in an operation.
* DF: Direction flag
- Controls the left-to-right or right-to-left direction of string processing.
* IF: Interrupt flag
- Determines whether or not the (CPU) will respond immediately to maskable hardware interrupts.
* TF: Trap flag
- Permits operation of a processor in single-step mode
* SF: Negative/Sign flag
- Indicates whether the result of the last mathematical operation produced a value in which the most significant bit (the left most bit) was set.
* ZF: Zero flag
- Set to 1, or true, if an arithmetic result is zero, and reset otherwise.
* AF: Half-carry flag
- Indicates when a carry or borrow has been generated out of the least significant four bits of the accumulator register following the execution of an arithmetic instruction.
* PF: Parity flag
- Indicates if the numbers of set bits is odd or even in the result of the last operation.
* CF: Carry flag
- Indicate when an arithmetic carry or borrow has been generated.
