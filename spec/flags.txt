Flag can refer to one or more bits that are used to store a binary value or a Boolean variable for signaling special code conditions.

In the case of the Pico86, flags store useful informations as booleans, where `0` is false and `1` is true, that can serve to store logical instruction results, such as `AND`/`OR`/`XOR`/etc.
