Memory in the Pico86 uses this memory structure:
* Memory: `uint8_t[0xFFFF]`, where `0xFFFF` is 1MB.
* CS: uint16_t --> Adress to code segment
* DS: uint16_t --> Adress to data segment
* ES: uint16_t --> Adress to extra segment
* SS: uint16_t --> Adress to stack segment
Each segment has a size of `0x1000` (64KB)
