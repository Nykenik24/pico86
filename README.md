# pico86
Virtual 16-bit CPU made in C that emulates x86.

## W.I.P
Pico86 is currently **Work In Progress**, here's a small roadmap:
- [ ] CPU main definition
- [ ] Memory management and utilities
    - [ ] Memory initialization
    - [ ] Segment accessing
- [ ] Register definition
- [ ] Instruction definition
    - [ ] Basic instructions (POP, PUSH...)
    - [ ] Logical instructions (AND, OR, XOR...)
    - [ ] Arithmetic instructions (ADD, SUB, MUL...)
    - [ ] Flow instructions (JMP, JNZ, JZ...)
- [ ] Execution pipeline
    - [ ] Fetch
    - [ ] Decode
    - [ ] Fetch Operands
    - [ ] Execute
